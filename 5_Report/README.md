# Requirements
## Introduction
- The Vehicle Seat Heater or Seat Heating Monitoring System is capable of generating mild heat in Seats, In this project a sensor (Pressure/Weight) placed at each seats in the vehicles, which tells us that passenger is sat on the perticular Seat or not. If the Passenger is seated then passenger need to set the tempearature accordingly (this tells us, paasenger switched on the heater). Based on these factors our controller generates heating capabality to seats.


- After that LCD Display should show the value of seat heater provided by the passenger through a nobe.


- Our project usually preffered in European contries, where temperature is too low.

## Objective


- The Objective of this Project/Activity is to Develop a user friendly heating system for seats of vehicles and to control the heating range of individual seat.

## Features
- The system uses Sensors to access the information about the paasenger is seated or not.


- Each seat should have a nobe to control/monitor the range of heat.


- A LCD display shows the temperature of Seat heater.


- Low cost.


## SWOT analysis - Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats
## STRENGTH


- Individual heating systems for each Seats.


- Can easily alter the temperature range.


- USer friendly.


- Low cost and Robust system.


## WEAKNESS
- Usually prefferd in Countries where temperatures are too low.


- Engine should be on to initiate this activity.


- More number of sensors required if the vehicle have more seats.


## OPPORTUNITIES
- It can be implemented by having both heater and ac.
- Can design remote, that can monitor/control the temperature of each seat.
- Can provide vibration system along with heating system.
- LCD display should recommend temperature to be set, based on environment tempearture (Outside of Vehicle).
## THREATS
- Use chances are less in High temperature places.
- We can't Turn it on before the passanger/person sitting on the seat.
## 4 W's & 1 H
## WHAT
- This Project concerned on providing mild heating Facility to the passenger via Seats.
## WHERE
- Prefferd in Automobiles and or Automotive Industries.
## WHEN
- At low temperature regions.
## WHY
- To maintain HEALTH in normal/stable state.
## HOW
- By generating a variable heat.
